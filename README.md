# üíªüõ†Ô∏è Capstone Project 1 - Capstone Toolstore (2021)

Hereby find the project brief, objectives and requirements of Capstone Project 1.

## About the Organisation

Capstone Limited is a small-medium company, based in the UK. There is freedom to choose what type of company Capstone is. 
It could be a product company (e.g., Selling Computer parts, Automobile parts, sports items, etc), or it could be a service company (e.g., Software Development, Gym, Service stores etc).

## Digital Transformation goal
Build a static website for Capstone Ltd to showcase their products and/or services so that they can reach their customers through the Internet.

## Project Brief
Capstone relies on printed catalogues and other non-digital marketing mediums to help showcase their products and/or services, and reach their customers. 
However, due to the pandemic and its disruptions on the mailing sector, Capstone has decided to own a digital platform display the wide array of their products. 
Because they hope this platform will eventually grow to also be their main platform for communication with their customers and sales generation, they have decided to go for a website.
The benefits include:
- A more diversified outreach for Capstone, which means more sales generation.
- An online presence, which would also mean the beginning of a stronger brand equity
and loyalty as they already have a good reputation with existing customers.

There are some important information about Capstone you need to take into consideration
when building your website. This will ensure it is fit for purpose.
- Capstone has no basic knowledge in web-development neither does it have an in-
house IT infrastructure.
- They currently do not have the resources to learn and develop a web page.
- Therefore, maintaining the website should require very little effort.
- Capstone will only invest after seeing the first version of the project, so you will
have to build the website at zero cost.
